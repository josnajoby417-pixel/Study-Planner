The main problem addressed by this project is the lack of extremely simple and distraction-free tools for students who need a quick way to plan and track their study activities. Many modern study applications are overloaded with complex interfaces and unnecessary features, making them inconvenient for users who want something fast and minimal. This project tackles that problem by offering a lightweight, console-based alternative that focuses only on essential task management functions.

The scope of the project is intentionally kept small to maintain clarity and usability. It focuses only on adding tasks, storing them temporarily during the session, and displaying them to the user. There is no long-term storage or advanced analytics, which keeps the project manageable and ideal for beginners learning core programming concepts such as loops, arrays, user input handling, and menu-driven program design.

The target users for this application include students, beginners in programming, and individuals who prefer minimal study planning tools. Students can use it to quickly note down tasks in a session without opening large applications, while programming learners can study the code structure to understand how interactive console programs work. It is also suitable for users practicing Python basics and experimenting with external libraries such as NumPy.

At a high level, the project offers essential features like adding new tasks, viewing the list of tasks, and exiting the application cleanly. Each feature is designed to work smoothly within a simple menu-driven system. The use of NumPy for dynamic task storage enhances performance and demonstrates how external libraries can improve program functionality. Altogether, the project successfully delivers a compact, functional, and easy-to-understand study planner.
